Contributing to Corrfunc
=========================
Corrfunc is written in a very modular fashion with minimal interaction between
the various calculations. The algorithm presented in Corrfunc is applicable to
a broad-range of astrophysical problems, viz., any situation that requires
looking at *all* objects around a target and performing some analysis with
this group of objects.

Here are the basic steps to get your statistic into the Corrfunc package:

* Fork the repo and add your statistic
* Add exhaustive tests. The output of your statistic should **exactly** agree with a
  brute-force implementation (under double-precision). Look at ``test_periodic.c`` and ``test_nonperiodic.c``
  under ``theory/tests/`` for tests on simulation volumes. For mock
  catalogs, look at ``mocks/tests/tests_mocks.c``.
* Add a python extension for the new statistic. This extension should reside in file
  ``theory/python_bindings/_countpairs.c`` or
  ``mocks/python_bindings/_countpairs_mocks.c`` for statistics relevant for
  simulations and mocks respectively. It is preferred to have the extension
  documented but not necessary.
* Add a call to this new *extension* in the
  ``python_bindings/call_correlation_functions*.py`` script.
  
  **NOTE**: Different from corresponding script in ``Corrfunc/`` directory.
* Add a python wrapper for the previous python extension. This wrapper should
  exist in ``Corrfunc/theory/`` or ``Corrfunc/mocks/``. Wrapper **must** have
  inline API docs.
* Add the new wrapper to ``__all__`` in ``__init__.py`` within the relevant
  directory.
* Add an example call to this *wrapper* in
  ``Corrfunc/call_correlation_functions.py`` or
  ``Corrfunc/call_correlation_functions_mocks.py`` for simulations and mocks
  respectively.

  **NOTE**: Different from corresponding script in ``python_bindings`` directory.
* Add the new wrapper to the API docs within
  ``ROOT_DIR/docs/source/theory_functions.rst`` or
  ``ROOT_DIR/docs/source/mocks_functions.rst``. 
* Add to the contributors list under
  ``ROOT_DIR/docs/source/development/contributors.rst``.
*  Submit pull request

**NOTE**: Please feel free to email the `author <mailto:manodeep@gmail.com>`_ or
the `Corrfunc Google Groups
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/corrfunc>`_ if you need help at any
stage. 


Corrfunc Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of the algorithms in Corrfunc have the following components:

* Reading in data. Relevant routines are in the ``io/`` directory with a
  mapping within ``io.c`` to handle the file format
* Creating the 3-D lattice structure. Relevant routines are in the
  ``utils/gridlink_impl.c.src``  and ``utils/gridlink_mocks.c.src``. This
  lattice grids up the particle distribution on cell-sizes of ``rmax`` (the
  maximum search radius).

  **NOTE**: The current lattice code duplicates the particle memory. If you
  need a lattice that does not duplicate the particle memory, then please email
  the `author <mailto:manodeep@gmail.com>`_. Relevant code existed in Corrfunc
  but has been removed in the current incarnation.
* Setting up the OpenMP sections such that threads have local copies of
  histogram arrays. If OpenMP is not enabled, then this section should not
  produce any compilable code.
* Looping over all cells in the 3-D lattice and then looping over all
  neighbouring cells for each cell.
* For a pair of cells, hand over the two sets of arrays into a specialized
  kernel (``count*kernel.c.src``) for computing pairs.  
* Aggregate the results, if OpenMP was enabled.


Directory and file layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Codes that compute statistics on simulation volumes (Cartesian XYZ as input)
  go into a separate directory within ``theory``
* Codes that compute statistics on mock catalogs (RA, DEC [CZ]) go into a
  separate directory within ``mocks``
* Public API in a ``count*.h`` file. Corresponding C file simply dispatches to
  appropriate floating point implementation.
* Floating point implmentation in file ``count*_impl.c.src``. This file is
  processed via ``sed`` to generate both single and double precision
  implementations.
* A kernel named ``count*kernels.c.src`` containing implementations for
  counting pairs on two sets of arrays. This kernel file is also preprocessed
  to produce both the single and double precision kernels.
* Tests go within ``tests`` directory under ``theory`` or ``mocks``, as
  appropriate. For simulation routines, tests with and without periodic
  boundaries go into ``test_periodic.c`` and ``test_nonperiodic.c``
* C code to generate the python extensions goes under ``python_bindings``
  directory into the file ``_countpairs*.c``
* Each python extension has a python wrapper within ``Corrfunc`` directory

Coding Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C guidelines
============

Code contents
-------------

* **Always** check for error conditions
* If an error condition occurs when making an kernel/external library call,
  first call ``perror`` and then return the error status. If calling a wrapper
  from within Corrfunc, assume that ``perror`` has already been called and
  simply return the status. Clean up memory before returning status.
* Declare variables in the smallest possible scope. Add ``const`` qualifiers
  liberally
* There **must** not be any compiler warnings (with ``gcc6.0``) under the given set of Warnings
  already enabled within ``common.mk``. If the warning can not be avoided
  because of logic issues, then suppress the warning but note why that
  suppression is required.
* Valgrind should not report any fixable memory or file leaks (memory
  leaks in OpenMP library, e.g., ``libgomp``, are fine)

Style
------
The coding style is loosely based on `Linux Kernel Guideline
<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle>`_. These are recommended
but not strictly enforced. However, note that if you do contribute code to
Corrfunc, the style may get converted. 

* Braces
  - Opening braces start at the same line, except for functions
  - Closing braces on new line
  - Even single line conditionals must have opening and closing braces
    
* Comments
  - Explanatory comments on top of code segment enclosed with ``/**/``
  - Inline comments must be single-line on the right 

* Indentation is ``tab:=4 spaces``

* Avoid ``typedef`` for ``structs`` and ``unions``

Python guidelines
=================

* Follow the `astropy python code guide <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/codeguide_emacs.html>`_
* Docs are in ``numpydocs`` format. Follow any of the wrapper routines in
  ``Corrfunc`` (which are, in turn, taken from `halotools <http://halotools.readthedocs.io/>`_)
